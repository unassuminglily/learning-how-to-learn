# learning-how-to-learn
My final project for the Learning How to Learn MOOC on Coursera

Instructions below:

This is the section where you get to "strut your stuff"--that is, to demonstrate to both yourself and others how much you've learned both inside and outside this class. (Remember, an important goal of this class is to help you to become an independent learner, so learning outside this class is okay!) You will need to receive at least a 70% final score to pass.

Ideally, this project could be used, not only to affirm your own understanding of the material and how it relates to your life and goals, but also to help other students and assist teachers and independent learners at any stage in their progression through a life of learning.

The key requirement of the project is that it is linked to multiple themes covered in the course. Beyond that, there is enormous flexibility. You might:

Create a presentation for your parents, friends, and teachers about what you’ve found to be the best tips for learning.
Write an article or textbook module about how to broaden your interests and passions—including a description of your own preliminary attempts to go outside your comfort zone in learning or trying something new.
Journal your efforts to get a better handle on procrastination and discover (and overcome!) your illusions of competence of learning.
Set-up a specialized wiki where students can exchange practical insights on how to learn most effectively.
Produce a miniature video documentary that conveys central ideas about learning in a humorous and memorable way.
Please be as creative as possible with this project. If you have a different idea than those on the list above, it might be helpful to run your idea by some of your peers (your "MOOC-mates") on the discussion forum, as they will ultimately be reviewing the project. You can also post your assignment in the discussion forum to ask your classmates for feedback before you submit it for review.

Whatever you decide to do for your project, please remember:

Substance over style. Demonstrating your knowledge about the topics in the course should come first in this project. Making your project pleasing to the eye or technologically impressive is less important than demonstrating your knowledge.

Don’t forget to take notes from the lectures and complete the readings, as your final project should touch on multiple course topics. You'll find that completing the weekly quizzes and participating in the discussion forum will help you master the material you will want to present in this final project.

Optional Cover Sheet

You can provide an optional cover sheet that helps provide an overview of the project--this can help your peer reviewers to see what you are intending to do with your project.

The cover sheet can contain:

A very brief (one to three sentence) explanation of how the project can or will be used in your life.
A list of the 3 or more topics from the course the project addresses.
If the project does not include citations, a brief justification of that decision. (Do not put the citations in the cover sheet.) For example, you might say something like "This project consists of a funny video, which didn't need citations."
Optionally, any other illustrations or explanations as to how the project meets the requirements of the grading rubric.
Note: there is no grade associated with the cover sheet.

Review criterialess 
Note: The evaluation sections can only be filled out during the evaluation phase.

After submitting your work, you will get the opportunity to grade the work of three of your peers. Your own work will also be assessed by your peers, from which we'll get your grade (which will be the median of your peer-evaluation grades).

The peer-review process gives you the opportunity to see a number of projects from your peers and be inspired by their creativity and insights. It also gives you a chance to evaluate the projects against the grading rubric and provide your MOOC-mates some suggestions on how to make their projects even better. The score you give the project will be ordered with those other participants give to the same project, and the median score will become that project’s final score.

While you are very familiar with your own project and the format you choose to use, other students may take a very different direction with their projects. That is a great thing! We want to let everyone create a project that will be meaningful and useful to them in light of what they've learned in the course.

Please note that all feedback should be given in English.

You can see the rubric that describes how your assignment will be graded by looking at the page here.

Here are some general tips on grading. DO:

If you are unsure in grading, please use the higher grade you are thinking of.
Remember that finding fault is just one definition of criticism. That is not the meaning of criticism in an academic context. The appropriate definition for criticism in peer review is this: the analysis and judgement of the merits and faults of a literary or artistic work. (Courtesy of Oxford Dictionary). Note that merits are mentioned first!
DON'T:

Base your score on whether you like or dislike the subject the writer is trying to learn about.
Make up your own grading rules or rubric.
Be offensive or disrespectful when you provide feedback.
† The evaluation rubric is based on that of Jonathan Tomkin, (University of Illinois), as developed for his course on Sustainability.
