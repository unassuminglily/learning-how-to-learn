        <p>Hi, my name is Lily and I made this website as my project to demonstrate how implementing the techniques from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/home/welcome" target="_blank">Learning How to Learn MOOC</a> improved
            my productivity and efficiency.
        </p>
        <section class="row">
            <div class=" col-xs-12" id="pomodoro">
                <h3 class="text-center">Pomodoro got me Going!</h3>
                <p>Who would‚Äôve thought that breaking my study time into 25 minute sessions would give me so much benefit? The Pomodoro Technique is a simple but efficient time management system that encourages people to work with the time they have‚Äîrather
                    than against it. So basically you break your work sessions into 25 minute chunks (Pomodoros) with a 5 minute break between them. After about 4 pomodoro sessions you can then take a longer break. The pomodoro technique was something
                    I easily picked up when taking the Learning How to Learn MOOC on Coursera. It would interest you to know that the parts in the lectures are usually within the 20-30 minute range before a practice quiz making you practice Pomodoro unknowingly.
                    In my other courses, particularly my web development course, I put Pomodoro to work and I was not disappointed.
                    <p></p>
                    <br>Although it was hard to stay focused at the beginning of the sessions, over time it became easier and my main motivation for each pomodoro would be the break. I saw my progress grow steadily and by the end of the course, I was
                    able to complete the final week in about two days without much procrastination and with more enthusiasm. Pomodoro works effectively because it helps one not to focus too much on the product of the task which can lead to procrastination,
                    but helps one focus more on the process. In my opinion, it‚Äôs an more helpful embodiment of the ‚Äúmotivational‚Äù phrase Trust The Process. At the end of my study sessions, I felt less tired, less blurry eyed since during my breaks I would
                    look away from my screen to do something else and I definitely felt much more accomplished.
                </p>

            <div class=" col-xs-12" id="diff">
                <h3 class="text-center">Diffused vs Focused Mode</h3>
                <p>I think we‚Äôre all familiar with the focused mode of thinking and we use it a lot when we‚Äôre learning something new. However, I learnt that there‚Äôs another way of thinking that makes learning easier and less draining and that is the diffused
                    mode of thinking. I think this analogy may be useful; when you‚Äôre in a dark room and you‚Äôre trying to find a light switch, if you use a laser pointer it would be a more demanding task because that little light would be focused on one
                    small area of the entire room and you'd have to slowly move around until the switch I found. However, if you use a lamp of flashlight, a greater light is cast and visibility is greater making it easier to find the switch. If you‚Äôve
                    not been able to figure it out already, the first scenario demonstrates how ineffective learning in the focused mode is and the latter demonstrates how diffused mode works.
                    <p></p>
                    <br>Although learning through intense concentration may work and make you feel like you understand better, you can agree with me that the process is tough and sometimes it takes longer than intended to understand a concept because
                    of possible mental blocks. This is where diffused mode becomes helpful: In diffused mode, you stop intensely focusing on a concept you‚Äôre learning and let your mind wander and relax a bit. While you relax, you can still think about
                    the concept you‚Äôre trying to learn and this helps the brain assimilate information more. It‚Äôs important to know how to learn in diffused mode as much as it is important to stop procrastinating. There are a lot of ways to enter diffused
                    mode and I‚Äôll highlight the ones I found effective below to wrap up how I learnt to learn.

            <div class=" col-xs-12" id="sleep">
                <h3 class="text-center">Sleep is Not for the weak</h3>
                <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/7zMxwVRIkl8vQhnH1V/giphy.gif" alt="sleep-deprived man">
                <p> Yes, you read that right! Sleep is critical for anybody's survival.<br> I believe it takes a lot of strength to sleep or rest a bit when you have an overwhelming amount of work piled up infront of you. It‚Äôs very easy to decide to keep
                    pushing through the fatigue but you need to understand that sleep even if sleep may be for the weak because that‚Äôs one way to build strength, a <i>lack of sleep will make you <em>weak</em>!</i> In one of the lecture videos in the first
                    week of the course, Barbara Oakley explained how when you‚Äôre awake toxins form in the brain and sleeping allows the body and the brain to detox and repair worn out cells and neurons. Sleep also allows your brain to strengthen important
                    parts of memories even as it erases less important memories and makes a remarkable difference in your ability to figure out difficult problems and to understand what you are trying to learn.
                    <p></p>I enjoy sleeping because I wake up refreshed and I can think more clearly when working or studying. Sometimes I even dream of the solution to problems I face and when I wake up although they may not be the right solution, there‚Äôs
                    a greater drive to solve the problem. If your nap taking game is risky like me, you there are other practices you can do to move into the diffused mode such as taking a walk or exercising. In order to stay healthy and work well, just
                    make sure that you have the recommended hours of 7 to 9 hours of sleep every 24 hours.

            <div class=" col-xs-12" id="practice">
                <h3 class="text-center">Practice, Practice, Practice and Repeat!</h3>
                <p>The last thing I will talk about is the importance of practice and essentially repetition. I grew up with ‚ÄúPractice makes perfect‚Äù but recently I‚Äôve been introduced to ‚ÄúPractice makes permanent.‚Äù This website you are viewing is as a result
                    of putting into practice all that I‚Äôve been learning from my courses on web development with this particular one being a modified version of one I completed <a href="https://www.coursera.org/programs/80ccfaf7-bef0-4a5c-b2a9-db236293f16a?productId=vhLVVTe9EeWnxw5wP_KHTw&productType=course&showMiniModal=true">here</a>                    on Coursera. A mentor was asked in a community learning group I‚Äôm in how many times we should practice as beginners and he said at least 4 hours a day. When I started learning coding online, I partnered with a friend and he suggested
                    we spend more time practising code and I‚Äôve come to appreciate the importance.
                    <p></p>Practice is a form of repetition and it doenst have to be done in one sitting. Spaced repetition and practice allows the mind to relax and make stronger connections to put new concepts in the long-term memory. Even with the Learning
                    How to Learn course content, it would be unprofitable to just watch the lectures, take the quizzes and not practice what was taught. It was in the practice that I figured out what worked for me and how to always use it for me advantage.
                    Although, I don‚Äôt always spend all the time well, small progress is still celebrated progress and I‚Äôm happy I‚Äôm well on my way to gaining more knowledge and skills before the year ends. Thank you for making it this far and I hope you're
                    inspired to learn how to learn better as well.
